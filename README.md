# [JSL04] Submission: Monster Ternary Operator



# Project Overview
In this project I was task to learn and use ternary operators in order to code a series of option based outcomes depending on the input that was set. I had to use these operators in order to 

# Project Brief
I had to work with the Monster Ternary Operator. I had to use ternary operators to make decisions based on various scenarios involving Monster Energy drinks. The ternary operator must decide between two options based on a condition, demonstrating its utility for concise conditional logic. While ternaries can make the code succinct, they should be used judiciously to maintain readability.

# Elements included 
- Ensuring that my code includes the necessary modifications to meet the challenge requirements.
- My GitHub repository should contain the updated code files.

# Reflections 

### Areas of mastery 
The ternary operater structure feels very comfortable to me after having completed the challenges and gone through the content. I believe that I have mastered the ternary operators. 

### Challenges faced 
Not many challenges faced in this project, I was able to obtain the desired result with the solutionn I provided. 

### Areas of Improvement 
An area of improvement that I would like to focus on, especially on future projects (which will require more), is finding better ways to write more elegant lines of code that reduce clutter and unnecessary lines of code. These operators showed me that it is possible, I would like to, however, find more succint solutions.

## Overall learning experience
My overall experience was quite positive, as I was able to adjust easier to operators in the JavaScript language and was comfortable enough with them that I understood how to code a solution.
